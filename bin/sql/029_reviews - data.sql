We had seen a great deal of her work with friends of ours and we didn''t hesitate to hire her when we were looking for a wedding photographer. She was everywhere during our ceremony, reception, and even in the parking lot when it was all over! She saw a background she wanted and she snagged my husband and me to take some shots as she was packing up her car! What impressed me the most (aside from the amazingly quick turnaround time for receiving our completed photos) was her attention to details that I''d have never thought of. Including insisting on good posture in the pictures, even the closeups (which definitely made a difference in the finished product). She also has an amazing eye for using light for formal pictures while creating amazing candid shots with that same eye. Our flower girl''s family ended up with beautiful professional shots just by Leigh Anne catching our flower girl at play. I definitely will be seeking Saperstone Studios for our future needs (anniversary and newborn photo sessions).', '/img/reviews/borelli.jpg');

Last summer the desire for some good family photos made me take the step of setting up a session with Saperstone Studios. Working with Leigh Ann turned the morning into a fun family outing. Her relaxed creative approach to the process had us laughing and talking as we walked through a local park stopping to take pictures along the way. The end result were fantastic family photos that included the six of us and two dogs. There were so many great family photos it was difficult to choose which ones to print. We will enjoy them for years to come....and you can be assured that when we need photos in the future....for a small group or a large family reunion we''ll call Leigh Ann to take the pictures.');

My fiance and I didn''t know what to expect on a shoot because we''ve never had professional photos taken. Leigh Ann was SO easy to work with and she put us at ease instantly. Half of the time we didn''t even know she was there, and the other half, we were laughing and joking with her! The photos turned out so beautifully and we have been recommending Leigh Ann to EVERYONE we know!! We really couldn''t be happier!');

Leigh Ann is incredible at what she does and we will use her for all future photo shoots! Starting with the engagement shoot- Leigh Ann made us feel at ease immediately. She was creative in how she posed us and caught us in moments where we didn''t even realize she was taking shots. The photos turned out beautifully. We had photos that were both serious and fun. She did a great job editing the photos and even used special effects to make one picture look like I was floating away with balloons why my fiancee was holding onto me! We created an album of our engagement pictures because there were that many good shots! For our wedding Leigh Ann continued to impress us! She captured beautiful shots of us, our family and friends! She makes every picture worth 1000 words! We can''t say enough good things about our experience with Saperstone Studios!');

She did an amazing job. She was very kind and accommodating throughout the shoots. During the Bris, she managed to get great shots without ever getting in the way of the ceremony, unlike some other photographers that will block everyone''s view. Our family photo shoot consisted of our newborn twins and family dog, and Leigh Ann and her helper Max were great with the kids and dog - very patient and got them into great positions looking at the camera. She also did great work editing the photos after the shoot. We posed on our carpet in an area with air vents. Leigh Ann edited out the air vents and other background objects so well that you couldn''t ever tell there was anything there. She also gave us digital copies of all of our pictures. We''ve printed out a ton, shared them online with family and friends, and used the pictures on holiday cards. The photo shoot was such a great experience and the pictures all turned out so well, we''ll definitely be using Leigh Ann whenever we''re in need of a photographer or updated family pics.');

First of all, she drove over an hour to meet us at a special spot for our engagement shoot. There was a threat of rain and we wanted to go for it anyway, but she was clear up front about any costs associated with booking an additional session if weather didn''t cooperate (thankfully, it did!). She made me and my fiance feel comfortable, even when we were "posing," and we''re glad she pushed us outside our comfort zone with some of the shots because they looked awesome!');

There are so many, many fantastic shots of my daughter & her husband, the wedding party, and the entire wedding and reception. I love the jewel tones of these images -- there are both exterior and interior shots, all perfectly lit.<br/><br/>Leigh Ann was creative and flexible, and very effective at getting people organized for the posed photos. There were a few unplanned waves of activity -- like family groups wanting their pictures taken with the b & g under the wedding arch -- but Leigh Ann coped beautifully and now we have wonderful family keepsakes. At the end of the reception, the b & g left under an archway of sparklers -- these photos, which must have been technically tricky to pull off in the dark, are really magical.');

She was excellent with communication and was very flexible with our schedules. On the day of our wedding, she and her team captured all the important moments that were important to us and some that I didn''t even know that was happening. Simply amazing work.<br/><br/>We highly recommend her services!');

I will never go anywhere else to have portraits done. Check out her website, and you''ll see what I mean!');

Leigh Ann is not only a great photographer, but feels like part of our family now. She has captured our most amazing life moments..from our engagement photos on a hike in the woods, to our maternity photos and now the photos of our precious son! We have such amazing photos of all these great moments in our lives because of Leigh Ann. She knows how to make us relax in front of the camera so she can really capture our personalities!!');
INSERT IGNORE INTO `reviews` VALUES (9, 1, 'Family Session', 'Hillary and George', '/img/reviews/hillary-1.jpg', '/img/reviews/hillary-2.jpg', 'After 3 sessions with Leigh Ann of Saperstone Studios, I cannot recommend her enough. The market is saturated with photographers, but Leigh Ann is much more than a photographer. She has a true talent and gift to capture the essence of a moment, a glance, a feeling, an emotion. She gives you creative freedom to bring props, pick locations, but she also leaves much to the moment facilitating priceless memories. Her images are vibrant and tack-sharp, edited carefully and efficiently. Leigh Ann both provides a product and service, but also an experience.<br/><br/>I have thrown many challenges at her and Leigh Ann has risen above and beyond each with a smile. She has braved heat, freezing cold and baby messes to get the priceless shots that will be forever cemented in our family''s history. For Leigh Ann we are eternally grateful. You will have a photographer for life if you select Saperstone Studios.');
