				<h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
				<p>
					CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
					websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's
					reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or
					company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
					operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information
					from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on
					its website stating exactly the information being collected and
					those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See
					more at: <a target='_blank'

				<p>
					Users can visit our site anonymously.<br /> Once this privacy
					policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as

				<h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>
				<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from
					children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online
					Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal
					Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency,
					enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of
					websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy
					and safety online.</p>

				<h4>Fair Information Practices</h4>
				<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
					privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have
					played a significant role in the development of data protection
					laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
					Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply
					with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

				<p>We will notify you via email
				
				
				<ul>
					<li>Within 7 business days</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires
					that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable
					rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to
					the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
					enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
					have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate
					and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
