                <p>I love, love, love engagement sessions and getting to know my clients without the rush and hurry on your big day. That's why I offer a complimentary engagement session in all of my wedding packages. It offers the opportunity for you to be comfortable in front of the lens and to see how I work. I get the chance to see you two as a couple and what makes you smile, laugh and get some wonderful natural reactions that are candid and <em>you.</em></p>
                <p>Interested in just the engagement session without the wedding photography? That's alright too! Contact me today for more information.</p>

                <p>Congrats on stepping into this next chapter of your lives as a force to be reckoned with. Nothing can take you guys down, including the wedding planning process!</p>
                <p>2016 wedding packages start at <span class='btn-danger'>??$2,700??</span> but are customizable to fit your needs for your day. All of my packages come with photography time on your wedding day, digital files on a USB with personal print release as well as an engagement session. I love being able to spend time with my couples at an engagement shoot before the rush of the big day. Who do you spend the most time with on your wedding day? Most likely it's your photographer so spending some time together to see how I work and become comfortable in front of the lens can make a world of difference :)</p>

                <p>Im a self proclaimed photo ninja. And when it comes down to it, haven't you always wanted to have a ninja at your wedding? ;) I have a photo journalistic style which means for the most part I stay out of the way and capture pure emotion as it happens. That being said, there are instances when I do step up and give direction to make sure your photos tell a story in the best way possible.</p>
                <p>Often when a couple is in front of the lens having their portraits taken they need a bit of direction on what to do. No fear, that's why you've hired me. It's my job to pose you both in a way that's natural as well as flattering. To ensure that your posed moments are still ones that are candid, fun and personable, I'll have you interact with each other...simple, right? But it's just oh so effective in making you both smile. :)</p>
                <p>There are other times when the light and/or composition is better in a certain room, I'll be on the look out for harsh shadows and and cluttered backgrounds and be sure to direct you when needed.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Oh.my. how I adore night photography. It's such a quiet time as you step away from the hustle of the party for a moment just for the two of you. I highly suggest working this into the timeline for your day if possible. It can take as little as 20 minutes but with more time allowed, you'll get more variations and angles.</p>
