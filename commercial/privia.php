				<p>Hi! My name is Leigh Ann and odds are I've recently photographed
					you on behalf of Privia Health. My contract with Privia allows them
					to use my images for their Privia.com website and for marketing
					your practice via Yelp.com. They are also allowed to use your
					images for their Privia print marketing needs such as brochures,
					info packets etc.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately my print release does not extend to you, the
					provider, but can be purchased for a discounted rate. Below is a
					brief FAQ to answer any questions you may have.</p>

				<h2>Headshot Print Release FAQs</h2>
				<h4>How much do images cost?</h4>
				<p>Images from your Privia session can be purchased for a discounted
					rate of $50 per image. This includes color correction, retouch and
					the print release.</p>

				<h4>What is covered under the 'print release'?</h4>
				<p>A print release allows you to use the image for your office's
					personal website, print/marketing needs such as brochures, prints
					to hang in your office, social media sites such as LinkedIn, etc.</p>
				<p>It does not allow you to sell the imagery to a stock agency or
					otherwise for personal monetary gain. The copyright is retained by
					Saperstone Studios.</p>

				<h4>Can't I just take the images from Privias website anyway? What's
					the harm...</h4>
				<p>No, that is copyright infringement and is ILLEGAL.</p>

				<h4>Is that really a discount?</h4>
				<p>If you were to contract me to come out and do the same session,
					prices start at $300 for a session, $80 for additional files, and
					additional fees apply based on image usage. I can extend a break in
					price to you as a Privia member because of our relationship with
					Privia.</p>

				<h4>How do I go about purchasing the images?</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Log in to the web gallery provided and select the images you'd
						like to purchase.</li>

						</ol>
