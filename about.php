                <h2>What Makes Saperstone Studios Unique</h2>
                <p>
                    It's all in the name, Saperstone Studios Photography and <em><a href='#' class='error'>Retouch</a></em>.
                    It's a digital age and as such the art of photography has expanded
                    beyond being able to compose and take beautiful photographs. Much
                    of the work that goes into your photos is what happens after you
                    download the images to the computer.
                </p>
                <p>How many times have you loved your smile in one photograph but
                    your sister thought she looked better in a different one? I can
                    make you both happy by combining the two images into one
                    flawlessly. Honestly, I would challenge you to pick out which
                    images have been altered and you wouldn't be able to tell.</p>
                <p>Many happy memories from your wedding will be the candid,
                    unplanned moments of joy with family and friends. Unavoidable
                    things can happen throughout the day from damaged boutonniere's to
                    distracting objects in your background. That is why Saperstone
                    Studios will put in the additional care to retouch your images at
                    our discretion to be album ready at no additional cost.</p>
                <p>
                    I've worked in the photography industry for over 10 years,
                    coordinating photo shoots and performing high level color
                    management and retouch for program books and billboards for
                    Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus <em>[[So many elephants!]]</em>
                    as well as a local DC fashion company managing the retouch workflow
                    and consistent quality control. <em>That's</em> the expertise and
                    knowledge I pass onto you.
