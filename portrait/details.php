				<p>Each time I pull out my camera I strive to provide a unique, fun
					photography experience. Often when clients are in front of the lens
					having their portraits taken they need a bit of direction on what
					to do. No fear, that's why you've hired me. It's my job to pose
					everyone in a way that's natural as well as flattering. To ensure
					that your posed moments are still ones that are candid, fun and
					personable, I'll have you interact with each other...simple, right?
					But it's just oh so effective in making the moment your own. :)
					We'll walk, we'll talk, and I'll most likely crack some jokes at my
					own expense but it's all in the name of having fun and capturing
					natural, fun moments that reflect who you are as a couple or
					family. My photography style is vibrant and colorful to reflect how
					you love life.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>Please allow 2-3 weeks after your portrait session and 4-6 weeks
					after your wedding for images to be completed. During this time I
					carefully make selects, color correct and retouch your images to be
					clean, consistent and vibrant.</p>

				<h2 class="page-header">What's Next?</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>When I'm close to completing your images I will reach out and
					schedule a time for you to visit my home studio in Fairfax, VA. I
					have a wonderful space set up with a large TV screen where I will
					help you make selects for your digital files and art for your
					walls.</p>

				<p>As a visual person myself, I wouldn't be able to make decisions
					in regard to prints on my walls without seeing it myself first. If
					you have a particular wall you want to hang photos on in your home,
					send me a snapshot (from your phone is fine) of the wall with a
					standard piece of office paper taped to it. I have an amazing ipad
					application that allows me to show you how large/small images will
					look on your actual wall to scale. The piece of paper taped to the
					wall helps the application resize the image accordingly. It makes
					customizing a cluster of images a breeze and it's fun to visualize
					exactly what your wall will look like.</p>
