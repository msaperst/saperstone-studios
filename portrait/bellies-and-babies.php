                <p>From the moment you realize you’re having a baby, you know it’s
                    going to be an amazing journey. Capture those precious moments in
                    your families life with Saperstone Studios. The first year is when
                    your baby will change and grow the most. Find out more about our
                    milestone photography session options below.</p>

                <p>Be sure to document your pregnancy with a maternity session.
                    Every pregnancy is unique so the exact timing of your session will
                    vary. Generally the best time is between 30 and 34 weeks. We want
                    you to be showing but also comfortable. If you're expecting twins
                    then schedule earlier!</p>

                <p>Newborns are best photographed during the first 10 days of life
                    to capture the sleepy stage. Be sure to schedule these sessions
                    well in advance as I only book a limited amount of newborns per
                    week to allow for flexibility with your due date. You'll have full
                    access to an array of beautiful props, blankets and accessories to
                    customize your newborns session. Upon booking, we'll pencil in your
                    newborns due date and schedule your session upon their arrival.</p>

                    These sessions can take place at <a href='galleries.php?w=14'>your

                <p>These sessions take place at 6-7 months, when your baby is able
                    to sit up unassisted. At this stage your baby will be smiling,
                    grabbing their toes, and showing off their sweet personality.</p>

                <p>Your baby can be photographed on location or at my home studio.
                    Both options are great and depend on the season/weather but also
                    what look you're going for. Outdoor shoots tend to be more candid
                    and varied, while indoor shoots tend to be more formal/planned with
                    backdrops and props.</p>

                    birthday than letting them go to town on a sugary surprise? Your
                    baby will likely be crawling if not walking by this stage! Cake

                <p>When's the last time you updated your family portrait? Often the
                    answer I get goes something like this... 'My kids hate dressing up
                    and never smile for me so I just don't bother'. This makes me so
                    sad! Don't miss out on documenting your little ones because you
                    view the process as stressful, it doesn't have to be! Kids love to
                    laugh. and PLAY and that's what we do at your portrait session.
                    Every child's personality is different and I can cater to them as
                    needed. In my experience, I've found that you can't just TELL
                    someone to smile. It needs to come naturally and you do that by
                    having a little fun ;) Do your kids love dinosaurs? Let's rawr! Do
                    they love to run? Let's race!</p>
