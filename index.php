			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>Allow me to introduce myself! I've worked in the photography
					industry for over 10 years, coordinating photo shoots and
					performing high level color management and retouch for program
					books and billboards for Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus [[So
					many elephants!]] as well as a local DC fashion company managing
					the retouch workflow and consistent quality control.</p>
				<p class="lead">I've started Saperstone Studios with the hope of
					providing not just photography, but also an experience.</p>
				<p>I serve the DC Metro area photographing countless moments for
					everything from weddings and engagements to family and events. Each
					time I pull out my camera I strive to provide a unique, fun
					photography experience where you can be, well, you! Many clients
					have let me know they didn't know what to expect but were
					pleasantly surprised how at ease they felt in front of the camera.
					We'll have fun capturing natural, fun moments that reflect who you
					are as a couple or family. My photography style is vibrant and
					colorful to reflect how you love life.</p>
				<p>I truly love flipping through my grandparents wedding album
					whenever I visit them, it brings me back to a time I obviously
					wasn't around to know them but the stories that get told are
					priceless and give insight to the people they were and the amazing
					people they've become. Photography isn't just for you. It's for
					your children and your children's children, and your children's
					children's child....well, you get the point :) Slow down and take a
					moment to capture life as it is now with a photography session with
					Saperstone Studios.</p>
				<p>I also provide retouching services that include restoring old
					photographs, enhancing poor wedding day photography, removing
					people/distractions, opening eyes etc. The possibilities are
					endless!</p>
